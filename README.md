# Data1030_Project_Akshay 

## Overview

This project will explore the potential success of startup companies by examining key features that economically and financially impact these companies. The target variable is categorical, the exit status of the company, and the only two options are acquired or closed. For simplicity, this model considers IPO and acquired the same category of ‘successful’ exit. This is a classification problem with the goal of predicting discrete success or failure of startup companies.
